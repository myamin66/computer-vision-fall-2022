We were studying filtering
Gradient & Rate of Change is same
Magnitude & 
Direction of Gradient is very important as edge can be either vertically or horizently

Convolution is associative	F*(G*I)= (F*G)*I => 2 kernals and image F,G = filters, l.h.s is good

R.O.I = Region of Interest, Weigheted mean is good for ROI. 
pixels around the ROI may also be same, thats why we take weighted mean

Gaussian Kernel: can do smoothing
	Near elements have high weights and vice versa
	g(x) = e^(-x^2/2o2)
When standard deviation infinte then the gaussian filter becomes mean
When standard deviation is zero or small value, then it a line
One by one kernel is nothing

we can control value using increasing or decreasing gaussian value and the filter will be same.
it has increased reusability
gaussian is smooth function
transform of gaussian is also a gaussain

in frequency domain, filters applied by mulitpying image and gaussian filter

experiemental evaluation, emperical evaluation

inherent filters in our eyes
	like gaussian filter
filters 
	edge dectioning filter
	motion detect filter
	system works by collaboration of filters
smooth cause info loss. sometimes we reduce info loss
smoothing can be done by average filter
we want to do smoothing, but not information loss
guassian is compuationaly very expensive. b/c we have to multiply eaxch filter with floating point. hectic

What is Edge: 
	Abrupt change in color intensity or gray levels
	change in the information of foreground and background

how to find edge
	first select inner or outer

algrothim to find outer edges and remove inner images

how to detect discountinuties
	find gradient, 	
ramp has no ege
larger the noise, stronger the response

how to remove noise: by smoothing using gaussian filter
so first apply gaussian filter to remove noise and then you can detect the edge
we can do this in single steps instead of two, first merge filter and then apply edge detection
when high noise, changes high and abrupt changes clearly visible

salt and pepper noise: 
salt = white color, pepper : black color
salt : random pixels value turned to zero
pepper: random pixel's value turned to 255
gradient magnitude: absolute

Prewitt Edge Detector:

by increasing the Threeshold value, edges detection increased
smoothing filter increase, noise decrease
means by controling smoothing detection, detection of egdes can be controlled

Prewitt and Sobel edge detector difference:
	Prewitt, 2 images in result (edges in x, edges in y) and then combine, filter should be square so it should have anchor point (prewitt two steps, smoothing + blurring)
	Sobel Edge Detector:
	Smoothing + Blurring in single step. very less computation. less smoothing becasue filter is not much capable

Marr Hildrenth Edge Detector (NOBLE Laureate)

Previous filters are detecxting edges on either less noise or high noise or color change but in reality its difficult
