evaluation metrics

in object detection, accuracy means how close bounding boxes are being drawn to the actual objects.

1) Frames per seconds(fps)
	how many frames an algorithm process in a second.
single shot algo are faster, but accuray is low as compared to region based algorithm

2) MAP mean average precision
3) iou: intersection over union
	it evaluates overlap between two bounding boxes(B_ground_truth, B_predicted).
	if iou is larger, more overlap, more accuracy
	standard value for iou is 0.5
4) Precision Recall Curve (PR curve)
	mostly precision and recall are inversally proportional
	area under the curve (AUC)

1) define and prepare problem

garbage in, garbage out (if not clean data given to the model, result will be garbage)
