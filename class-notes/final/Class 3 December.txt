evaluation metrics

in object detection, accuracy means how close bounding boxes are being drawn to the actual objects.

1) Frames per seconds(fps)
	how many frames an algorithm process in a second.
single shot algo are faster, but accuray is low as compared to region based algorithm

2) MAP mean average precision
3) iou: intersection over union
	it evaluates overlap between two bounding boxes(B_ground_truth, B_predicted).
