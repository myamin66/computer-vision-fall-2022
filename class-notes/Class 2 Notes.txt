Two ways to perform work
	- Scientific approach: solve problem by good methods, optimize, see all aspects, we can fine-tune, Computer Vision
	- Engineer's Approach: just work should be done, how its working does'nt matter, Black-Box Approach, Deep learning. Only expectation


3d Technologies:  
	constructions of picture of child before even birth. application of cv in medical
	Allignment of images is also CV

Avtar also CV. now a days in metavers
	if avatar works samle like human, and you want to have all emotions.

Detect in CV : 
	find and localize

C.V vs human Vision: 
	multipe MRI, brain tumer, multiple men count, 
	in some tasks human good: Reidentification, Recognition: computer too literal, Airplane examplel

Intersection over union: 
	metric for checkig performance

Visual Perception: 
	Things near to us are large, small when far
	Process of acquiring knowledge about environmental objects and events by extracting info from the light they emit or reflect
	Children seeing all things, but dont understand. your grandmother, father. we are telling visual cues as well as language

	The focus of our eyes is fixed, we dont see other things
	
can people 'see' without being aware of what they see?

Why do objects appeared colors?
	Receptors in eyes: Rods and Cones : Detect colors
6-7 M Cones, 1 M Rods
feature extraction, object detection, recognition

same picture for human and C.V
	we can extract information and develop story

Rods detect grays-scale and cones detect color

digital image: a 2d matrix, where each object is representing gray level
pixel: a single element from image

Sampling and quantiztion
	8-bit qunatization: each element represting by 8 bits xxxx xxxx (range can be 0-255)
	2-bit quantization: black or white

more color in frog: more poisionic, the predetor will check first before eating
green color in trees because of photosythensis

mental capacity + training + interest : developing distinction 

Panorama picture, stitching, Computer Vision

Zero mean guassian noise
rate of change of gray levels (gray levels from white to black)
