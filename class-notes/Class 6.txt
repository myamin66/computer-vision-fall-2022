Outlier rejection: removing outliers. diff techniques, rotation

Laplacian of Gaussian, Difference of Gaussian (LoG, DoG)

Trace of Hassian matrix/ Determinant

Shitomassi, outlier rejector performance metric (focus either computation or high outliers removal)

histogram representation is good because we can match (robust representation)

original representation may be ambiguous: e.g half black half white

Gradient oriented Histogram: GOH

principle components in reality: 360 degree, david loe made 36 bins

low number of descriptor: low chances 

we want to match descriptions from one image to other

0--------------------35 (information of bins), four 

features after blob detection

flat service already removed, we found interest points


simplest matching approach: sabk sath match karien

medium = spread of gaussian 

best  = emperical evaluation (0.4) value of sigma

SIFT and harris corner detector, both provide points at the end

how to make sift features rotation invarient: by matching bins information

Description matching not pixel wiase matching

best description is that, which is not changing

deep learning and computer vision features different : cv learning process is very different

google image search works by finding the features of your given image and matches it with features of other images. these features are not deep learning features;




Hough Transform
