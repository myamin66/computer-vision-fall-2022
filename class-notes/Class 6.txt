Outlier rejection: removing outliers. diff techniques, rotation

Laplacian of Gaussian, Difference of Gaussian (LoG, DoG)

Trace of Hassian matrix/ Determinant

Shitomassi, outlier rejector performance metric (focus either computation or high outliers removal)

histogram representation is good because we can match (robust representation)

original representation may be ambiguous: e.g half black half white

Gradient oriented Histogram: GOH

principle components in reality: 360 degree, david loe made 36 bins

low number of descriptor: low chances 

we want to match descriptions from one image to other

0--------------------35 (information of bins), four 

features after blob detection

flat service already removed, we found interest points
